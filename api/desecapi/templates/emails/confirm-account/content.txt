Hi there,

You have registered with deSEC a long time ago (on {{ created|date:"Y-m-d" }}), probably to
set up a DNS domain (e.g. under dedyn.io).  At the time when you registered
your account, we did not verify your email address.

Our terms now require that deSEC account holders provide an up-to-date contact
email address, in case we need to contact you (e.g. when there is a problem
with your domain).  We are currently cleaning our database and making sure
that all addresses are verified.

Therefore, if you would like to continue using your deSEC account, you now
need to verify your email address.  To do so, please use the following link
(valid for {% widthratio link_expiration_hours 24 1 %} days):

{{ confirmation_link.0 }}

If you do not want to continue using deSEC, we will delete your account once
the link has expired, without contacting you again.  In case you miss the
deadline, we invite you to sign up again with the same email address.

We apologize for the slight inconvenience, and hope you enjoy deSEC!

Stay secure,
Nils
